<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Minnesota (UMN), Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/).

Prior to this, I received my MS and BS in Computing Science from [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/), and a BS in Materials Science & Engineering from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do).

My research focuses on creating simple but effective machine learning solutions that are efficient, robust, and generalizable for real-world applications.

<span style="color:red"> **I'm always open to collaboration on AI, ML, computer vision, HCI projects. Feel free to contact me!** </span>
