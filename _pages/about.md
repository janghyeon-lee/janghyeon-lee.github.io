# About 
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Minnesota (UMN)](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang](https://knowledge-computing.github.io/). My research interests lie in machine learning (ML) with a focus on the spatiotemporal domain (space and time). I am particularly interested in developing ML models that can perform effectively even with sparse and unevenly distributed data. I am also passionate about HCI for addressing prevalent societal issues, such as phobias like speaking anxiety and behavioral challenges like smartphone addiction. Finally, I am excited by how AI can enable more interdisciplinary research, driving me to explore ways to bridge the gap between domain experts and ML practitioners for more seamless collaboration.

Prior to this, I received my MS and BS in Computing Science from [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/), and a BS in Materials Science & Engineering from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do). I also did an internship at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), which ignited my journey in AI.

<span style="color:red"> **I‚Äôm always open to collaboration! Feel free to reach out.** </span> If you‚Äôre a UMN student, you‚Äôre welcome to stop by my office in Keller Hall, Room 5-248.
